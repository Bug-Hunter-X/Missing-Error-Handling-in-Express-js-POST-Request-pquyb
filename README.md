# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for invalid or missing request body data in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code lacks proper validation and error handling. If a client sends a POST request without a body or with invalid data, the server won't handle it gracefully, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation and comprehensive error handling.  This includes checking if the request body exists and if it contains the required data in the correct format.  Appropriate HTTP status codes are used to communicate errors to the client.
